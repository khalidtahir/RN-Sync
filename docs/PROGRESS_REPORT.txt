RN Sync: iOS-Based Centralized Monitoring Hub – Progress Report

Project Team: Group 22 (Benjamin Nguyen, Jack Fergusson, Khalid Tahir, Ziyad Soultan)
Faculty Supervisor: Nasim Montazeri
Submission Date: January 20, 2026

The RN Sync team has completed Milestone 2 (Backend Build), deploying a production ready serverless infrastructure on AWS with HTTP endpoints at https://vuoog0y6uf.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com and WebSocket streaming at wss://dn118dyd65.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/. The backend supports real-time patient data ingestion with OAuth 2.0 authentication and comprehensive data management.

The architecture implements three AWS Lambda handlers and five service modules. The API handler provides RESTful operations, the WebSocket handler enables real-time streaming, and the authentication handler manages secure connections through AWS Cognito. Service modules handle patient records, vital sign ingestion, document metadata, RESTful coordination, and authentication, utilizing Supabase for data persistence. The data flow supports synchronized multi-sensor streaming where devices authenticate with Cognito, establish WebSocket connections, and stream vital signs with patient ID, metric type, value, unit, and UTC timestamp. The handler validates payloads, normalizes timestamps, and persists readings. Clinicians retrieve data via HTTP endpoints for real-time monitoring and historical queries with metric filtering.

Testing includes nine Jest test suites with over 200 cases covering unit and integration scenarios. Unit tests validate business logic and error handling while integration tests simulate Lambda execution flows. An end-to-end simulator validates production deployment by executing Cognito authentication, establishing WebSocket connections, generating synthetic vital signs for heart rate, SpO2, and ECG, and confirming persistence, successfully demonstrating concurrent streaming for four streams per subject as per project blueprint.

The project security implements OAuth 2.0 through AWS Cognito with JWT validation and TLS 1.3 encryption. Complete technical documentation has been produced, including a System Overview detailing runtime architecture and deployment procedures, API Documentation with endpoint specifications, and a Best Practices guide for coding standards. The deployment leverages Lambda with Node.js 22.x, API Gateway for both HTTP and WebSocket interfaces, Cognito for identity management, and Supabase for time-series storage in the us-east-2 region. This implementation addresses all Required System Specifications outlined in the blueprint, including TLS 1.3 encryption, OAuth 2.0 authentication, WebSocket connectivity for real-time streaming, and UTC timestamp normalization for cross-device time alignment. The modular architecture minimizes processing overhead to support the target sub-500ms p95 latency requirement. With Milestone 2 complete, the team will now proceed to Milestone 3 (iOS UI Build) to develop the React Native frontend with API integration, visualization components, and patient dashboard functionality.
